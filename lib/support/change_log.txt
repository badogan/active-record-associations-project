04Dec19 - v1
- Introduced faker (also updated gemfile)
- Completed screen flow with the "happy path"
- Conducted some "manual" testing for "unhappy paths"
- Changed #list_activities method:
    Removed "puts.." messages from the method and placed it in the CLI interface
- Fixed a bug for "0 calories"
- Fixed a bug so that exercise ids are taken from the table as expected.

Notes:
1. Seed data does not properly calculate calories_burnt. They are fake.
However, they are updated correctly when update function is called (regardless what is updated - duration or execise type- 
calories_burnt calculated and written to table)

Known Bugs:
